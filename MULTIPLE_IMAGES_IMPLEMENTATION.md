    ├── main.jpg              (Main image - in database)
    ├── detail_1.jpg          (Gallery image 1)
    ├── detail_2.jpg          (Gallery image 2)
    ├── detail_3.jpg          (Gallery image 3)
    ├── detail_4.jpg          (Gallery image 4)
    └── ...                   (Up to detail_8.jpg)
```

### Database:

```sql
products.image = "Images/product/Sp{id}/main.jpg"

4. createProduct() → Returns product_id (e.g., 19)
5. processMultipleProductImages(19, main, details)
   ├─ Create folder: Images/product/Sp19/
   ├─ Upload main.jpg
   ├─ Upload detail_1.jpg, detail_2.jpg...
   └─ Return path: Images/product/Sp19/main.jpg

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Không thể tạo thư mục sản phẩm"

**Check:**

- Folder permissions: `Images/product/` needs write access
- Apache user needs permissions

**Fix:**

```powershell
# In PowerShell
icacls "C:\xampp\htdocs\Web_TMDT\Images\product" /grant Everyone:(OI)(CI)F
```

---

### Problem: Images uploaded but don't show in gallery

**Check:**

1. Folder created? `Images/product/Sp{id}/`
2. Files in folder? `main.jpg`, `detail_1.jpg`...
3. Database path correct? `Images/product/Sp{id}/main.jpg`

**Debug:**

```powershell
# Check folder
Get-ChildItem "C:\xampp\htdocs\Web_TMDT\Images\product\Sp19"

# Should show: main.jpg, detail_1.jpg, detail_2.jpg...
```

---

### Problem: Preview doesn't show

**Check:**

- Browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- File selected actually?

**Fix:**

- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Clear browser cache

## 📊 COMPARISON: Before vs After

### After Implementation:

```
Admin uploads: 1 main + up to 8 details = 9 images total ✅
Saved to: Images/product/Sp{id}/ folder (organized) ✅
Product detail: Auto shows all images in gallery ✅
Gallery: Works automatically, click to change ✅
```
